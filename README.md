# Pagination & Content Filter
### Treehouse Techdegree Project #2 - Pagination & Content Filter

In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that has too much information. To make it easier to find information and read the page, you'll use progressive enhancement to add pagination.

The page includes a list of 54 students. You need to add programming to display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students.

Your solution should work for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 student listings.

Optionally, you can add a search bar to let users search the list of students for a particular student or students.

Feel free to use jQuery for this project, but please avoid using plugins to achieve the pagination and/or search functionality.


# Project Requirements

### Progressive enhancement & unobtrusive JavaScript
- [x] No inline JavaScript. All JavaScript is linked from an external file.
- [x] Use unobtrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links
### Pagination Links
- [x] Pagination links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there’s 66, 7 links should be generated.
### Paging
- [x] The first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
- [x] Clicking on “1” in the pagination links should shows students 1 to 10. Clicking “2” shows 11 to 20. Clicking “5” shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
### Code comments
- [x] Code comments explaining how the functions work

# Appraiser Comments
Great job! Pagination can be tricky but you were able to get it working which is something to be proud of. Trial and error can be a good way to try to solve problems, especially when you're first starting out. As you keep coding, you'll get better and better at trying to solve and debug problems. If you feel like coming back to this project down the road to see if you can accomplish the exceeds requirements, take a look at some of the methods you've already used and some of them would be helpful. For example, the .push() method will come in handy when searching for and displaying matching student results. Great job on the project. Congrats!
